                   <b> The marketing concept and marketing systems</b>
                </p>
                <p class="text-dark text-center fs-6 fst-italic">
                   <b> Marketing is not simply an extension of the production process but its only purpose as Adam Smith
                    emphasised when, in his text The Wealth of Nations (1776), he said that:

                    “Consumption is the sole end purpose of all production: and the interest of the producer ought to be
                    attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.”

                    Dixie2 relates what he describes as a definition of marketing which is:

                    “The series of services involved in moving a product (or commodity) from the point of production to
                    the point of consumption.”

                    This is a definition which many organisations, and governments, would recognise as describing their
                    own activities in commodity marketing. Indeed in many developing countries it aptly describes, or in
                    some cases, did in the past describe, the functions carried out by marketing parastatals with
                    respect to staple foods. However, as Dixie himself points out, the definition omits two key elements
                    of any definition of marketing production to effuse the marketing concept, i.e. a customer
                    orientation and inbuilt sustainability. Gaedeke and Tootelian3 offer an alternative definition which
                    overcomes the problems caused by these two omissions:

                    “… a management orientation focusing all the activities of the organization on satisfying customer
                    needs and wants, thereby helping achieve the organization's long-range objectives.”

                    This definition promotes a customer orientation and since the organisation's long-term objectives
                    will include it's own continued existence it takes account of the need for sustainability. Moreover,
                    this definition of the marketing concept does not preclude non-profit making organisations.
                    Marketing is just as relevant to development projects, aid agencies, extension service
                    organisations, and the like, as it is to commercial enterprises. Thus the marketing concept is that
                    an organisation achieves its goals through the provision of customer satisfaction. Put another way,
                    marketing is the integrative force that matches production to customer needs and satisfaction.
                    Marketing is not an activity to which an organisation turns its attention at the end of the
                    production phase of operations. Rather marketing needs to be directing production in accordance with
                    clear signals from the marketplace as what is needed by customers.

                    The marketing concept must be adopted throughout not only the entire organisation, but the entire
                    marketing system. A system is a complex of interrelated component parts or sub-systems which have a
                    defined common goal. Thus, an agricultural and food marketing system comprises all of the functions,
                    and agencies who perform those activities, that are necessary in order to profitably exploit
                    opportunities in the marketplace. Each of the components, or sub-systems, are independent of one
                    another but a change in any one of them impacts on the others as well as upon the system as a whole.

                    There is a danger that the marketing concept will be adopted by some parts of the system but not
                    others. Thus, for example, a food manufacturer may be trying hard to implement the marketing concept
                    and offer products that meet the precise needs of a target market. If, however, the manufacturer has
                    to rely upon a farming community that is still very much production oriented, for raw material
                    supplies, then the overall marketing objectives may be frustrated. In the same way, if only some
                    functions are performed according to the marketing concept then the system as a whole may not
                    achieve a market orientation. For instance, the marketing department may set out to serve the market
                    for a high quality fruits and vegetables, for which it can obtain premium prices, but if
                    transportation is performed using the same open-topped bulk carrying wagons used to ship grain and
                    other aggregates then it is unlikely that the enterprise will deliver the product in the right
                    condition for the target market. </b>
